Supermarket Sales project:
-Tools & tech 
Power-bi, csv, power-query, Dax
Load the row csv data and clean it using power-query 
Build the relationship between the tables to sure that we have a readable filter 
Analyzed all the data using dax measures to see top sales by item and sub-category and the most sale out branch 
In this report I made consumer behavior analysis to see the sale out item for each gender and the place as well 
and final step share the insight among the stack holders
